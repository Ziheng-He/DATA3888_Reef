## Things to note with dash
1. When using an M1 Mac, the rpy2 package runs into issues when calling R components. Easiest solution is to not use an ARM based computer, stil with intel processors for now. From testing, the dash can use R models just fine on an intel Mac.

2. Packages required include dash, sklearn, rpy2, plotly and pandas. There is a requirement.txt file.


## Running
1. Run the file with python at this path: ./Dash/main.py 

2. Once the terminal prompts you with a localhost, click it to see the dash in your browser.
